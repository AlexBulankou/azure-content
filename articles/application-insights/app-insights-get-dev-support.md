# How to get technical support from Application Insights development team
	
When you have a technical issue that is not described in documentation, the first step is to ask a question on one of our forums:

* [MSDN forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/home?forum=ApplicationInsights)
* [StackOverflow forum](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ms-application-insights)
	
However there are situations were you would like developers to investigate your specific case. If you have support plan with Microsoft Azure you can open a ticket by following this link: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/options/
If you don't have a support plan, our development team is happy to offer to best effort support for AppInsights customers. You can describe your case to us by submiting a feedback on Azure portal.
Click on the smiley face icon in the top right corner to open Feedback panel.
