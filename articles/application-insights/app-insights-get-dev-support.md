# How to get technical support from Application Insights development team
	
When you have a technical issue that is not described in documentation, the first step is to ask a question on one of our forums:

* [MSDN forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/home?forum=ApplicationInsights)
* [StackOverflow forum](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ms-application-insights)
	
However there are situations where you would like developers to investigate your specific case. If you have support plan with Microsoft Azure you can open a support ticket by following this link: https://portal.azure.com/?#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade .
If you don't have a support plan, our development team is happy to offer best effort support to Application Insights customers as we are preparing for General Availability milestone. We are introducing a new support option: you can describe your case to us by submiting a feedback form on Azure portal and have a developer on Application Insights team contact you back to help resolve your issue.

Click on the smiley face icon in the top right corner to open Feedback panel.

In the comment box please make sure to specify **AppInsights** as first line and then include the following information:   
```

ikey: <instrumentation key>   
sdk: <SDK that you are using, including name and version>

issue: <please describe the problem you are having>
```

Please check "Yes, it is ok to email you" checkbox at the bottom of the Feedback panel and click Submit button.

An engineer on Application Insights team will get in touch with you soon. As we are providing this service on best effort basis, no formal SLA can be given at this point.
